excerpt: I remember reading a blog about how so many programmers can't program back in uni and I always believed this to be an exaggeration. Now that I finally got a chance to have first hand experiences, I can't be more surprised.

I read this observation once - 
> A surprisingly large fraction of applicants, even those with masters' degrees and PhDs in computer science, fail during interviews when asked to carry out basic programming tasks. For example, I've personally interviewed graduates who can't answer "Write a loop that counts from 1 to 10" or "What's the number after F in hexadecimal?" Less trivially, I've interviewed many candidates who can't use recursion to solve a real problem. These are basic skills; anyone who lacks them probably hasn't done much programming.
